## Introduction

Chicken of the VNC is a VNC client for Mac OS X.  A VNC client allows one to display and interact with a remote computer screen. In other words, you can use Chicken of the VNC to interact with a remote computer as though it's right next to you.

More information about VNC can be found at AT&T's compendium: http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/.

Chicken of the VNC was originally written by Helmut Maierhofer for OpenStep on Intel. Jason Harris ported it to the Cocoa API on Mac OS X. Chris Reed has continued the work with many improvements, fixes, and updates.

Helmut's original version was called VNCViewer, but as there are already several VNC programs on Mac OS X with this name, Jason decided to save some confusion and call it by this horrible Chicken name instead.
